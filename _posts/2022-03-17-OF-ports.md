## Discovering OpenFrameworks

During my spring break week at Columbia, I had a bit of time to myself
and decided to try out some creative coding frameworks, mostly just
for fun. Processing (Java) and p5.js (JavaScript) seem to be the two
most popular choices for quick visualizations of cool graphics or
mathematical phenomena, but I wanted to use a C++ framework because
C++ is the language I'm most familiar with. In the concluding sections of
the blog post, I also share some experiences in approaching a
new framework, or at least what has worked for me.

I first came across interesting projects created by [Necessary
Disorder](https://necessary-disorder.tumblr.com/) (a French creative
coding artist), and his mind-boggling graphics animations really
impressed me. He mentions his code is mostly done with Processing, but
after checking out his GitHub page, I didn't find much public source
code for me to learn from. I then dug into the Coding Train channel
(Daniel Shiffman) on YouTube, which is always a great pleasure to
watch, and found two specific projects that interested me: [Fluid
Simulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alhpH6ECFvQ), and
[Mandelbulb 3D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJCiUVGiNyA).

## Pixel Fluid Simulation

By following Daniel's video, I learned that he is mostly
re-implementing the formulae of [this master's
thesis](https://mikeash.com/pyblog/fluid-simulation-for-dummies.html),
which itself is based on [this
paper](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/public_user/stam/reality/Research/pdf/GDC03.pdf). I'm
no expert in fluid dynamics so I won't even attempt to explain the
mathematical formulae. My main goal was to restructure Daniel's
Processing code into clean modern C++, and in the process learn about
useful OpenFrameworks functions, such as `ofNoise()` for
multi-dimensional Perlin noise, `ofClamp()` for constraining values,
as well as some self-explanatory ones like `ofGetElapsedTimef()` and
`ofDegToRad()`. I also got the chance to use the GLM library and
extensively interact with `glm::vec2` and `glm::vec3` and the
various functions that can operate on them. I realized that
OpenFrameworks has many similar functions to the ones in Processing,
so porting the project from framework to framework with the help of
documentation wasn't as much of a hassle as I thought it'd be.

Below is a GIF to showcase the final result. And here's [my source
code](https://github.com/ianyepan/fluid-simulation-OF) on GitHub (with
many links to references for those interested).

## Mandelbulb 3D

Mandelbulb, for those who aren't familiar, is essentially a
three-dimensional geometric construct with extremely detailed
structures at arbitrarily and infinitely small scales. The idea is
borrowed from its 2D ancestor, the [Mandelbrot
set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set), which is the set
of complex numbers that do not converge when plugged into a
specially-designed iterative formula. Due to their alien-ish
psychedelic aesthetics, there are passionate communities using these
mathematical derivations for creative artwork, two examples of which
would be the [Maths
Town](https://www.youtube.com/c/MathsTown/featured) YouTube channel
and [this gallery
collection](https://www.skytopia.com/project/fractal/gallery/) of
mind-blowing renders. (Some readers may find the overly-complex
details a bit discomforting. View at your own discretion.)

I followed Daniel's video and the formulae
[here](https://www.skytopia.com/project/fractal/2mandelbulb.html#formula)
and tried a few different parameter combinations. In the end, power 8
seems to be the sweet spot (as pointed out by many others).

I really liked Daniel's approach in designing the object-oriented code,
so I mostly followed his structure. I separated the utility functions
and global constants into a separate header file with their own
namespaces, and set up an interactive camera to view the 3D scene with
`ofEasyCam`. It provides us with basic controls like rotating the 3D
construct with the left-mouse drag and zooming in and out with the
scroll wheel.

Finally, I created the resulting point cloud below. You can find my
source code [here](https://github.com/ianyepan/mandelbulb-OF).

## Approaching a Framework: My Experiences

In the past, I've always geared towards watching video tutorials on
YouTube for a quick start. But lately, I've (re)found the value of
written tutorials and books. The main difference for me was that
reading triggers me to think on my own a bit more since text-based
tutorials often leave space for the readers to ponder. By taking away
the "easiness" of watching some well-prepared YouTuber code a bug-free
application, I also get more chances to run into problems and gain
experience through debugging. It is also a good approach to ease my
way into new documentation, as text-based tutorials and books often
reference the documentation extensively, and through reading the book
I'll inevitably grow familiar with looking up information about this
framework on my own.

I highly recommend the official OpenFrameworks
"collaboratively-written book", called
[ofBook](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/of_philosophy.html). It
covers OF project structures, from basic 2D graphics with vectors and
polylines to advanced graphics with OpenGL meshes and shaders. It also
covers sound and network, as well as a few more hardcore mathematical
topics, typically handled through GLM. I am only halfway through the
book and have already learned so much about OpenFrameworks. (Speaking
of books, I'm also reading an SFML book because I found the framework
to be a well-implemented C++ abstraction for me to interact with
OpenGL. I've tried a bit of SDL2 and GLFW, but the low-level buffer
handling keeps me from being completely sold. Perhaps in the future
when I'm more familiar with graphics programming, I'll give the other
two libraries a second try.)
