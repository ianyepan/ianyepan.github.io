### Journey of a Linux newbie

> Originally written on April 10. 2018

For my future self and those interested in GNU/Linux overall and my
one-and-a-half-week journey with it.  I first got into Linux because
of 'Mr. Robot' (still my all-time favorite TV show by the way), so
naturally the first distro I chose was “Kali Linux”, which I didn’t
know then, was possibly the worst beginners’ choice available. Not
only because it comes with 600+ pre-installed hacking tools that I’ll
probably never use (I’ve only learnt to use less than 10 of them so
far), I also dangerously run as root from default.

I decided that I’ll need to choose a daily distro for general use
(file editing, coding), instead of making Kali my main operating
system and use it only when I want to practice penetration test
exercises (i.e. hacking, in a legal way).  After some decent research
from browsing through no less than 10 books from our library, hours of
YouTube and mainstream forums, I narrowed down the options to 4
choices, namely Ubuntu, Mint, Debian, and Fedora.

Ubuntu (the most mainstream distro by far) was let go first, merely
because I wanted something more special for myself. Mint was out
second, because I have, over my hacking time with Kali, grown to
become a fan of the Gnome DE, and Mint failed to offer me that.
Debian is the distro of stability, releasing updates only when they
are thoroughly tested out. Fedora on the other hand stands for
bleeding-edge, releasing upgrades/updates sometimes even just hours
after the development. I installed Debian on a virtual machine
operating on my Pro and wrote Fedora into the hard disk of my Air
(after some serious suffering) to run the final round. In the end, I
went with Fedora.

GNU/Linux to me is more than an operating system, it is the GNU’s
almost socialist philosophy I respect and inspires millions. The idea
of a coder sharing the source code for free which he worked on for
years even made me sit through an entire GNU/Linux documentary
voluntarily for the first time in my life. I am a beginner in the
Linux community, and I’m proud to be a part of it.


### Update

> May 12. 2021

After 3 years of daily Linux CLI interaction (I'm a CS student after
all), I've become somewhat more knowledgeable then when I first wrote
this post.

Currently, I'm Arch Linux on WSL2 and always have Ubuntu 20.04 as my
backup plan. In fact, I'm writing this very blog post in Ubuntu
because there are some weird issues going on with Arch + WSL2.
